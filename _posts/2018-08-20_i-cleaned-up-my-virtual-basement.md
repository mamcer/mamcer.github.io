Something that I quickly realized and definitely love from my profession (I'm a System Engineer BTW) is how easy and cheap is for us to create compared to other disciplines. I'm not talking about big commercial systems, if you want to build the next GitHub you won't probably go far without some level of Money investment. I'm talking about create something, just because you are learning, trying a technology or building something to address a specific problem. At the very basics you only need a computer, the tools, time and focus.

Fortunately through time it is becoming easier and cheaper the access to technology. From hardware and also software perspective. From the .NET perspective no need of Visual Studio trials or limited express editions for this kind of development. You are not even tied to the Windows licensed platform anymore.

In that context and since I remember I always had one or several side projects in progress. Most of them never hit 'production' but the expression "The important thing is the journey, not the destination" is true in my case.

## The Destination

POCs, MVPs, get to the RTM point. 

## The Journey

Have the opportunity to work on technologies years before I had the opportunity to work with them in a paid job (some of them I never had the opportunity). Not in particular order: TFS, Mercurial, Git, WPF, Silverlight, Windows Phone applications, WebForms, ASP NET MVC, WebAPI, Continuous Integration/Delivery/Inspection, automatic deployments, IIS configuration, VMs with different Linux distributions, AngularJS, Docker, .NET Core, SonarQube, real time functionality with SignalR, unit testing with mstest, xunit, etc etc

I learnt a lot of .NET just by testing the latest framework features as POCs or take a new release as an excuse to upgrade a previous side project (or rewrite it completely). I remember to have TFS in a virtual machine on my 2GB of ram laptop. Installing Atlassian JIRA, Bamboo and Crucible in my media center. Implement a continuous integration process in TF Online (Now Visual Studio Team Services). Playing with Git (working with VS Express for Web) years before I have the opportunity to use it in a job environment. Deploy web applications to local VMs running different Windows Server versions. And again a long etcetera.

Also countless of medium/large systems implementing the latest technologies designed in paper that never reached even the MVP level. 

## The Basement

Well, the experience and learning is something that becomes part of you. But at some point last year (2017) I went down to my virtual basement where all the projects were archived. I took a look and realized, first that they were many of them, they were at different level of completeness, some of them still current, a good number outdated/obsolete and all representing hours or days of work. But they also share something: they were all there, hidden, and I decided to change that.

## The Selection

I found zip files with code in backups disks, private repositories in Visual Studio Team Services (since 2012), Bitbucket (since 2014) and local TFS and Stash (later Bitbucket Server) instances.

From the application perspective I found C++ programs from early 2000 to 'modern' .NET web applications and rest api from 2016. 

Near the end of 2017 I finished a list of the project I wanted to publish in GitHub. Initially I expected to have all of them migrated by the end of January 2018, then March, and then.. well it took a little more time but it is done. Initially I started to review them, reorganize the code, implement some cleanups and refactors with some ReSharper help, run SonarQube analysis and fix rules, add unit tests to increase coverage, etc. Then realized it will take me almost another nine years to finish so I published them with an original untouched branch and master with some level of reorder, cleanups and refactors (no SonarQube or code coverage improvement)

## The Final Result

A curated list of twenty three projects from early 2007 to 2016 published on GitHub. 

You may think that most of them are trash (and you are most probably right!) to me it was like a time travel enjoyable task and in some way gratifyingly like when you finish a task that for some reason you postponed for a long time.
