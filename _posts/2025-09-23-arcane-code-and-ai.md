title: Arcane Code and AI
subtitle: Playing with Gemini CLI, ChatGPT and Claude Sonnet

A while ago, I was sorting through old (very old) files. I found the assignments I did in college and literally my first programs or codes written, first in Pascal and then in C++.

Review them with VS Code, nostalgia, re-archive, forget them again.

A few days ago I remembered those codes and now the idea of ​​playing with AI, why not?

Among the programs, I found the final project for Algorithms I (1999), which consisted of generating a simple C++ program that encodes and decodes a message in limited Morse code. Using the statement as a starting point, I asked Gemini (CLI), ChatGPT (Web), and Claude Sonnet 3.5 (from VS Code Copilot) to create a Golang implementation. Just to clarify that all three are free versions, currently I'm not paying for any AI services.
