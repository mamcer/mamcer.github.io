subtitle: Hi, I'm Mario

I'm a technical leader with over 20 years of experience building software and people. I have experience with several technologies like C#, Golang, MySQL, architecting solutions that range from on-premises monoliths to cloud-native microservices. I'm proficient across Linux, Windows, and Mac platforms and I am passionate about using modern DevOps practices to ensure efficient and reliable software delivery.

Since I remember I enjoy tinkering things. I found in technology a way to view, design and create. Passionate about learning, technology, teaching and quality.

I born in [Balcarce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balcarce,_Buenos_Aires) studied System Engineering in [Tandil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandil) and then moved to Buenos Aires, Argentina. This blog, its content and opinions are my own.
