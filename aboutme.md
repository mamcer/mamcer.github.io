I'm a software developer with more than 20 years of professional experience, most of them in the .NET stack but since a couple of years ago I'm working with Golang and several non Microsoft technologies 

Since I remember I enjoy tinkering things. I found in technology a way to view, design and create. Passionate about technology, learn, teach and quality. Not always in that order

I born in [Balcarce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balcarce,_Buenos_Aires) but I live in Buenos Aires, Argentina since more than a decade ago. My current position is IT Manager at [Mercado Libre](https://jobs.mercadolibre.com/), this blog, its content and opinions are my own
