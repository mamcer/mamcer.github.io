I am a software developer with more than 20 years of professional experience, most of them in the .Net stack but not tied only to Microsoft related technologies. As for example I have experience working with Golang and other technologies on Windows platforms and since several years ago Linux and Mac.

Since I remember I enjoy tinkering things. I found in technology a way to view, design and create. Passionate about learning, technology, teaching and quality.

I born in [Balcarce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balcarce,_Buenos_Aires) studied System Engineering in [Tandil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandil) and live in Buenos Aires, Argentina since more than a decade ago. My current position is Software Engineering Senior Manager at [Mercado Libre](https://jobs.mercadolibre.com/), this blog, its content and opinions are my own.
