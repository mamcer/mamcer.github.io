I'm a developer with more than 12 years of professional experience, most of them in the .NET stack. 

I born in [Balcarce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balcarce,_Buenos_Aires) but I live in Buenos Aires, Argentina since more than a decade ago. Manager at [Mercado Libre](https://mercadolibre.com/), this blog, its content and opinions are my own.

Since I remember I enjoy tinkering things. I found in technology a way to view, design and create. Passionate about technology, learn, teach and quality, not always in that order.
