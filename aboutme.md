I'm a software developer with more than 20 years of professional experience, most of them in the .NET stack but since several years ago I'm working with Golang and several non Microsoft technologies 

Since I remember I enjoy tinkering things. I found in technology a way to view, design and create. Passionate about technology, learn, teach and quality. Not always in that order

I born in [Balcarce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balcarce,_Buenos_Aires) studied System Engineering in [Tandil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandil) and now live in Buenos Aires, Argentina since more than a decade ago. My current position is IT Manager at [Mercado Libre](https://jobs.mercadolibre.com/), this blog, its content and opinions are my own
